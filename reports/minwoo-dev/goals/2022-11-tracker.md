# CODE EVERY DAY

> **Objective**: Complete at least a 100 Days of Code Challenge "challenge" every day and two if possible.

## Log

1. **2022-11-20** - First day, created a branch minwoo from main branch develop of the AsaKatsu Project. Gonna complete at least one pull request today. Ticked the completed days so far of the 100 Days of Code challenge.
2. **2022-11-21** - Second day of using GitHub, had trouble updating my local copy (fork) of the main branch so it will be the same as the main, used merge upstream command to update; will look more into the commands used in this platform. Completed the day 38 of the 100 days coding challenge and I could pretty much say I still have a lot of concepts that don't quite fully comprehend yet. Will do more research and study about it.
3. **2022-11-23** - Skipped a day to take a breather because I felt that my brain had information overload. First time being a SPEAKER for a space today hosted by avie-dev! Thank you for the opportunity! There were a lot of listeners and it was a nice way to start into the tech world (I guess). I have written a Hangman game within the Replit website but really had to look at the solution for assistance in the flow logic of the program. I think I got it but I still have to review the needed concepts (really bad). I also found out I can't rebase to upstream if I have "uncommitted" changes. So I guess I have to save this first, push and ask for a PR.
4. **2022-11-24** - Proceeded with day 40 of the 100 Days Coding challenge in Replit. Finally learned how to create a basic dictionary and access and print out its data by creating a simple contact card form asking the user to input their own information, store into a dictionary and print out using f strings.
5. **2022-11-27** - Completed two challenges today as a makeup for the rest day I took yesterday (or the other day?). Finally able to somehow understand how dictionary works and using None as a null when there is no value yet assigned to a particular key. Completed day 41 and 42 today so it is something I want to celebrate (yay! small wins!). Anyway, I hope I will be able to finish the course I am currently studying in Udemy right now so I can catch up with my hyung in programming (I look up to him, hi Jhaycee haha). Will study Japanese more as preparation both for the JLPT (3rd take) and the certification exam I will be taking soon enough when I am ready. Faito! I'll be an engineer soon! No matter how slow, progress is progress.
