# About AsaKatsuProject
A project where you can keep track of your goal's progress, and contribute to opensource in the same time.

*AsaKatsu* is a Japanese term for waking up a little early to do something productive, in line with a goal.
For example; Read 4 books per month, do 100days challenge, etc.

In this project, everyone who will commit will have to do a thing or two every morning and log the progress here.

# How to Contribute
▼0. Set your goal and break it into smaller chunks.
For example you want to read 4 books in one month. Break it down to “Read one book per week”, or smaller, “Read xy chapter per day”.
Be sure that your goal is **SMART**.
- **S**pecific (simple, sensible, significant).
- **M**easurable (meaningful, motivating).
- **A**chievable (agreed, attainable).
- **R**elevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).
- **T**ime bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).

1. [Fork](https://github.com/avie-dev/AsaKatsuProject/fork) this repository.
2. Create an issue stating your goal. You can use the set goal template or create your own format. Feel free.
3. Create a new branch with this format: asakatsu/<github_handle>
   - It is advisable to haveonly  one branch. Work one thing at a time.
   - If you need another branch, aside from goal setting, you can create one
      - feature/<your proposal>
      - bugfix/<your proposal>

4. Create your folder inside **asakatsu_reports**. And then create a subfolder like the one in the image below.

7. Close the issue when you're done with the goal.
