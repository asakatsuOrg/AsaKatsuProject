Day 4

Should've given emphasis here as well, I'll be working out alternate days! As expected, my body is pretty sore right now but I am recovering pretty well! Here are the only things I did for today:

- Woke up early for a meeting but got cancelled so I decided to continue working on my personal project (a project/sprint management web app) for 6 hours.
- Also did some light boxing :>

Overall, I am recovering well and ready to workout again tomorrow!
